The LaTeX code (".tex") is already prepared to be executed. 
You just have to copy-paste and compile it in Overleaf.

The pdf generated after compilation contains all the figures which appear in chapters 1 and 2: 
fig 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 & 1.4 / fig 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 & 2.4

These graphs have been generated using the tikz package, a really powerful tool for producing vector graphics in LaTeX.
